1. We will not ignore conflict, all issues no matter how small will be addressed.
2. Take a breather (step away and cool off before situation escalates)
3. We will clarify what the current issue is by communicating when something arises. 
4. During pair programming bring all involved parties together to talk. 
5. When necessary escalate to classmate inside our group that is not involved with the conflict.
6. Identify a solution after dicussing the situation; this may require an outside viewpoint.
